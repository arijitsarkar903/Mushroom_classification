**Overview**
This project focuses on classifying mushrooms into edible, poisonous, or of unknown edibility/not recommended categories based on their characteristics. The dataset used includes descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family Mushroom, drawn from The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms (1981).

**Dataset Description**
The dataset contains features such as cap shape, cap surface, cap color, bruises, odor, gill attachment, gill spacing, gill size, gill color, and more. Each mushroom species is labeled as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not recommended.

**Project Steps**
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Detailed analysis of the dataset to understand distributions, and patterns.

**Classification Models**
Logistic Regression: Achieved an accuracy score of 95%.
Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier: Achieved an accuracy score of 96%.

**Conclusion**
The models developed in this project aim to predict the edibility of mushrooms based on their characteristics with high accuracy. Understanding these predictions can help in mushroom identification and safety during foraging activities.
